## App features
- High customizable: Set the interval, state, volume and sound in the app GUI, every option will be persisted after close
- No Windows visual polution: The main GUI can be safely "closed" to hide taskbar icon, you can restore the GUI or close the app via the notification icon
- Run and forget: Auto pause is enabled by default, so no annoying noises outside the game

## Options
- Status: shows if the app timer is paused or not
- Time: interval between each sound is played, in seconds
- Sound: the sound name located at "Sounds" folder, any audio file there should work, but was tested only with .mp3 and .wav
- Volume: the volume of the sound, 0 is muted
- Auto pause: if enabled, will only play the sound if the game window is open ( game window name: "League of Legends (TM) Client" )
- Activate/Deactivate: pauses/unpauses the timer
- Terminate: terminates the app

- In the sound selector, the "Refresh" option is used to re-scan the Sounds folder 
- To add new sounds, just copy then to the Sounds folder ( if it does not exists, will be created when launch the app )
